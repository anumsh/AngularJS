<!-- ng-app, ng-model and {{}}  are the directives/ build-in attributes

Directives are markers (attributes) on a DOM element that tell AngularJS to attach a specific behavior to that DOM element

ng-app: The ng-app directive is a starting point. If AngularJS framework finds ng-app directive anywhere in the HTML document then it bootstraps (initializes) itself and compiles the HTML template.

ng-model: The ng-model directive binds HTML element to a property on the $scope object

An expression is like JavaScript code which is usually wrapped inside double curly braces such as {{ expression }}. AngularJS framework evaluates the expression and produces a result.
